## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out my solution for the front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Summary! üìñ
This challange took me a bit longer to complete, but I am happy with the overall result.
I am aware that it isn't pixel-perfect with the design, there are bits that are off, but I am still satisfied with the overall result.

I think the code is a little bit messy, but I'll go over that in the Areas of Improvement section.

The challange itself wasn't too difficult, a tinny bit harder than the 'Newbie; difficulty challange, but it was still very enjoyable.

## Areas of Improvement ‚öíÔ∏è
Code needs to be more clean, no messy bits, a straight forward layout.


## Thinks to Keep in Mind for the Next Time üß†
Be consistent with design and code (Avoid having duplicate & messy code)
Try to match design as closely as you can.
